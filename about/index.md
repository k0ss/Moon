# Blog Purpose
In order to secure a system, you need to look at all the code that can be influenced by user input, but to break it you only need to find one mistake.  I want to teach how to make systems break by finding the mistakes that someone else missed.

I will highlight some of the exploitation and reverse engineering projects I've worked on, and also mix in some techniques I use to ensure a more stable or stealthy exploitation that should be relevant to both the complete novice and the veteran hacker. If you would like to know more about something security related, drop me a line by email and I'll see what I can do!

In this blog, it is my intent to share with you:
 * What I'm working on
 * New techniques I've picked up
 * New tools that have helped me find vulns

* Perform in-depth static and dynamic code analysis.
* Reverse engineer custom network protocols to aid vulnerability analysis.
* Create documentation for existing tools and create new tools to automate bug discovery.
* Assess memory corruption bugs for exploitability.
* Lead an intern project to create an internal fuzzer management framework.
* Implement an tool for feedback-based fuzzing of server binaries without source code or reversing.

**VMWare, Inc.** | **Security Engineer** | **Austin, TX** | **07/2016-08/2017**

* Performed in-depth static and dynamic code analysis.
* Reverse engineered custom network protocols for vulnerability analysis.
* Researched using open source tools like AFL and angr to automate bug discovery.
* Assessed memory corruption bugs for exploitability.
* Hunted down more complex bugs such as cryptographic implementation flaws.

* Led the effort of security testing websites and embedded devices on the campus network.
* Compiled detailed reports of each vulnerability found, and how to fix it.
* Assisted with imaging of computer clusters.

## Security Research
* Reported vulnerabilities in websites/software
 * ArmedAssult.info SQLi, XSS (2007)
 * OpenText FirstClass Code Execution (2011)
 * *Emby Media Server multiple vulnerabilities (in progress)*
* Contributed to open source concolic execution engine Angr project
* Practicing new techniques to get code execution (ROP, Heap Spraying, [how2heap](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap))
* Wrote x86 shellcode to bypass character restrictions
* Static/Dynamic Binary Analysis using IDA, Immunity Debugger, gdb, windbg

## Education / Certifications
**University of Maine** | **B.Sci. in Computer Science** | ***German Minor*** | **2014**
* CCDC Team Co-Captain & German Club President
* 4 years of Spanish & German courses

**Corelan Advanced Exploitation**
* Learned advanced heap exploitation and browser exploitation

**CISSP "Associate"** (Passed CISSP exam, need 5 years industry work experience to get CISSP)
* This exam seemed like a waste, but I had to suffer through it so it goes here!
